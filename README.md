## Requirements
[Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)\
[SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)﻿\
[ReShade 5.9+ with full add-on support﻿﻿](https://reshade.me/)

## Configuration
To configure ReShade Toggler, open the ReShade overlay and navigate to the Add-ons tab. By default, the functionality to disable all effects on the Map Menu, Main Menu, and the Loading Menu is enabled.

For each feature, you can specify whether it should toggle all ReShade effects or specific effects (.fx files). You can also save and load your configuration presets. Use the refresh button to recheck all configurations, which is necessary when adding new INI-Configs.

If you wish to create a more complex preset, we highly recommend using the toggling of specific effects. Enabling all effects can quickly become incompatible with other configuration options.

You can locate the saved presets at the following path: Data\SKSE\Plugins\TogglerConfigs\PresetName.ini.

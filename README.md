# Description
With some reshade presets, some menus like the map are too bright. This brought up the idea for this SKSE plugin. It activates/deactivates the reshade effects in the menus that were set in the INI.
By default, the reshade effects are disabled in the main menu, loading screen and map. Which and how many menus are affected can be configured as desired in the ReshadeToggler.ini.
